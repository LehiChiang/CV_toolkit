# Web Crawler to download images from websites

## Introduction

​        In the field of computer vision, whether it is object detection or object segmentation, a large amount of image data is an important factor for the model to pursue high training standards.But capturing a lot of image data is still a tricky problem for developers. In this regard, we propose a Python-based web crawler method to automatically scrape image data provided by various search engines from a website.

​        The current project only provides crawling methods for Baidu Images search engine. Other image search engines, such as Unsplash and Google Images, will be provided in subsequent developments.

## Quick Start
